        <p>Machine learning is one of the best field of Compute science. <b style="color: yellow;">Machine Learning</b> is a type of Artificial intelligence(AI) that provides computers with the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Machine Learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can teach themselves to grow and change when exposed to new data.Machine learning studies computer algorithms for learning to do stuf. We might, for instance, be interested in learning to complete a task, or to make accurate predictions, or to behave intelligently.</p>
